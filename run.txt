How to run this project (Windows - CMD)

Prerequisites:
- You must have a C++ compiler available in CMD: g++ (MinGW-w64).
- This project already includes SFML headers and libs inside the "SFML\" folder.
- Required SFML .dll files are in the project root (same folder as main.cpp).

Step 1) Open Command Prompt (CMD)
- Press Win + R, type: cmd, press Enter

Step 2) Go to the project folder

cd /d "D:\BSCS\3rd Smester\Object Oriented Programming\Final_Project (Simple_Game_Engine)\Simple_Game_Engine"

Step 3) Compile (build) the game

g++ -Wall -Wextra -g3 -I.\SFML\include main.cpp -o output\main.exe -L.\SFML\lib -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-audio -lsfml-window -lsfml-system

Step 4) Run the game

output\main.exe

Common issues (quick fixes):
- If CMD says: 'g++' is not recognized...
  - Install MinGW-w64, then add its "bin" folder to your PATH environment variable.
  - Reopen CMD and run: g++ --version

- If the game closes instantly / says DLL is missing...
  - Make sure the SFML *.dll files stay in the project root folder (where you run the exe from).
  - Always run it from this folder (do NOT double-click main.exe from another working directory):
    cd /d "...\Simple_Game_Engine"  then  output\main.exe
